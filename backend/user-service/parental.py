"""Parental supervision — and, just as deliberately, its limits.

The specification is unusually direct about this feature, and it is right to
be: supervision that quietly becomes surveillance does more harm than no
supervision at all. A teenager who believes their parent can read their private
messages stops using private messages for the things private messages are for —
including telling somebody that an adult is pressuring them.

So this module is built around a list of what a parent **cannot** do, and that
list is served to both of them at an endpoint. Not buried in a policy document:
returned by the API, in plain words, to the parent and to the teenager, before
either of them agrees to anything.

**What a parent can see:** that supervision is active, the teen's privacy and
safety settings, time-limit settings and daily usage totals, and a record of
requests the teen has made to weaken a safety setting.

**What a parent cannot see, ever, through any endpoint here:** the content of
private messages, who the teen messages, their posts, their searches, their
browsing, their location, their friends list, or anything they have read. None
of it is exposed, and none of it is stored for this purpose.

Two design choices that carry most of the weight:

*Either side can end it, and the other is told.* A teenager cannot be held
under supervision they did not agree to and cannot escape. Silent revocation
would be its own problem, so the parent is notified.

*Ending supervision buys no permissions.* Where the jurisdiction requires
parental consent, an account that leaves supervision reverts to the strictest
settings rather than becoming free. Otherwise "remove your parent" would be the
documented way for a 14-year-old to unlock everything, and this feature would
be a lock with the key taped to it.
