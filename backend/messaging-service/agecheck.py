"""Who may open a private conversation with whom, and what they may send.

The privacy layer already asks the recipient's own setting through
``permissions.check``. This adds the layer a member cannot set for themselves:
a 14-year-old who has left their messages open to anyone has not thereby
consented to unknown adults, and a platform that treats that setting as the
whole answer has made a child responsible for their own safeguarding.

Two rules, and one signal.

**The rules.** An adult reaching an unconnected minor is refused. A younger
teen reached by anyone they are not connected to is refused. Both come from the
shared engine, so the answer here is the same one the feed and the media origin
would give.

**The signal.** Refusals are recorded. One adult mistyping a handle is noise;
the same account refused by eleven different minors in a week is not, and the
only way to see the second is to have kept the first. The score this produces
feeds back into the engine, which lowers the bar for refusal as it rises — it
never concludes anything about the person on its own.
