"""A community behaves like a group: you join it, you post in it, members read it.

What was wrong before: `community_id` on a post was a free text field nobody
checked, the audience rule excluded community posts from every feed, and no
endpoint listed them. So a post written into a group was accepted, hidden from
everyone, and unreachable - and anybody could address a post to a private group
they had been refused.

The checks below are the group, stated: a non-member cannot post, a member can,
members see each other's posts in their own feed and on the community, and a
private community does not leak to outsiders.

Run against the local stack:  python backend/tests/e2e_community_posts.py
