"""Does a file start the way its declared type says it does?

The upload endpoint used to trust the Content-Type the client wrote: a file full
of "x" declared video/mp4 was stored, and later handed to a browser as a video.
The browser would refuse it, but the platform had still taken it in, classified
a post around it and kept it. Checking the first bytes is cheap, and it moves the
mismatch to the one moment it can be refused with a clear reason.

This is a check of the *start* of the file only, and it is not a scan: a file
can begin like a PNG and carry anything after. What it rules out is the cheap
lie (HTML, a script or random bytes named image/png), which is also the one an
UploadCenter-hosted file would be refused for on their side. It is applied to
the types a post can carry; a chat attachment may be any file at all.
