"""Deciding how suitable a piece of content is, before anybody sees it.

Until now everything was `UNCLASSIFIED`, which the engine treats as adult-only.
That was safe and nearly useless: adults saw far less than they should, and
nothing ever became visible to a teenager.

This is the pipeline that gives content a rating. It is built around one
admission that most content-moderation code declines to make:

    **A text heuristic cannot look at a photograph.**

So it does not pretend to. A post carrying an image or a video is never
auto-cleared by this module — there is no amount of reading the caption that
tells you what is in the picture. Those posts stay restricted and go to a human
queue, or wait for a vision model to be configured. A classifier that marked
them GENERAL because the caption was innocuous would be the single worst bug
this codebase could contain.

What it does do:

* clears text-only posts that carry no signals, which is most of them;
* grades the ones that do, per category rather than with one flag;
* refuses to let a minor publish sexual content at all, rather than rating it
  18+ and serving it to adults;
* routes anything with an exploitation signal out of ordinary moderation
  entirely.

Three backends, in order of preference: a vision/moderation **model** when one
is configured, the **heuristic** below, and — for anything neither can settle —
a **human**. The first is absent today; the design is here so that configuring
a key is all that is needed, not a rewrite.
