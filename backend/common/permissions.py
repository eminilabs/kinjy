"""Ask user-service what one member may do to another.

There is exactly one implementation of "are they connected, and does their
privacy setting allow this?" — it lives in user-service. Every other service
asks. Three copies of that logic would drift, and the copy that drifts is the
one that leaks.

Every helper here **fails closed**: if user-service cannot be reached we refuse.
An outage must not become a way around someone's privacy setting.
