"""Encryption at rest for members' private data — messages and chat attachments.

**What it protects against:** a copy of the database, a backup, or the media
volume ending up in the wrong hands. Everything sealed here reads as noise
without the key.

**What it does not:** someone in control of the running server, which holds the
key in its environment. Only end-to-end encryption, with keys on the members'
devices, closes that; this is not that.

The key
-------
``MESSAGES_ENCRYPTION_KEY`` holds one or more keys, newest first::

    MESSAGES_ENCRYPTION_KEY=k2:<base64 32 bytes>,k1:<base64 32 bytes>

The first key seals everything new; every listed key can still open what it
sealed, which is what makes rotation possible without re-encrypting in one go.
Each sealed value records the id of the key that sealed it.

Generate one with::

    python3 -c "import base64,secrets;print('k1:'+base64.urlsafe_b64encode(secrets.token_bytes(32)).decode())"

**Losing the key loses every message sealed with it, permanently.** Keep a copy
somewhere that is not the server and not the database backups — a key stored
next to the backup it protects protects nothing.

Absent in development, present in production: a production service without a
key refuses to start (:func:`require_in_production`), because a stack that
quietly writes plaintext when the variable is forgotten is worse than one that
does not boot. A key that is present but malformed is always fatal, for the
same reason.
