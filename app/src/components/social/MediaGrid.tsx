/**
 * A post's pictures, laid out the way people expect them.
 *
 * What was wrong before: every image was `object-cover`, which crops. A single
 * portrait photo — most phone photos — lost its top and bottom, so a picture of
 * somebody arrived with their head cut off, and a screenshot arrived unreadable.
 * Several images were forced into fixed-height halves, so three pictures left a
 * gap and five were simply all there, each one short and cropped.
 *
 * The rule now follows the count, because what is right depends on it:
 *
 * * **One** — never cropped. The whole picture, at its own shape, centred on a
 *   dark ground and capped in height so a very tall image does not push the
 *   next post off the screen. A single image is the post; cutting it is cutting
 *   the post.
 * * **Two** — side by side, equal, cropped to match. Two pictures of different
 *   shapes sitting at different heights reads as a mistake.
 * * **Three** — one tall on the left, two stacked on the right.
 * * **Four or more** — a two-by-two grid, with "+N" over the last tile when
 *   there are more. Cropping is right here: the grid is a contact sheet, and
 *   the viewer is one tap away.
 *
 * Cropped tiles are centred on their subject as far as CSS allows
 * (`object-cover` keeps the middle), which is why the single-image case is the
 * one that must not crop: there is no grid to keep tidy, only a photograph.

/**
 * The shape a feed picture is allowed to be, as a width/height ratio.
 *
 * The same limits Facebook uses: nothing taller than 4:5 and nothing wider
 * than 1.91:1. Outside that range the picture is cropped to the limit rather
 * than shown whole, because a 9:16 phone photo shown whole is a column of
 * image two screens tall that buries the next post.

 * The shape of a multi-picture block, as width/height.
 *
 * A ratio rather than a height in pixels. The heights here used to be h-64 and
 * h-80 - 256 and 320 - chosen when the feed column was about 814px wide. The
 * column is 560 now, and a fixed height cannot follow it: the same h-80 that
 * gave reasonable tiles at 814 was producing 278x158 tiles, a ratio of 1.76,
 * which is a letterbox slot. A portrait photo in one of those is a vertical
 * strip of its own middle.
 *
 * These are chosen so the tiles come out close to square, which is what every
 * other feed does and what a cropped thumbnail wants to be:
 *
 *   two   - side by side, so the block is twice a square tile
 *   three - one tall beside two stacked; the tall one reads as a portrait
 *   four  - a two-by-two of squares, so the block is square itself
 *
 * Expressed this way they hold at any column width, including a phone's.
