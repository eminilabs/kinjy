## Getting started

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then bring the stack up:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

| Surface | URL |
|---|---|
| Frontend | http://localhost:3030 |
| API gateway | http://localhost:8200 |
| Gateway docs | http://localhost:8200/docs |
| Stack health | http://localhost:8200/api/status |
| Postgres | `localhost:5445` (user `kaluta`) |
| RabbitMQ console | http://localhost:15675 (guest/guest) |

Every service also publishes its own OpenAPI page, e.g. the ledger at
http://localhost:8210/docs.

## Services

| Service | Port | Schema | Owns |
|---|---|---|---|
| gateway | 8200 | — | routing, single origin, `/api/status` |
| auth-service | 8201 | `auth` | accounts, sessions, passkeys, deletion, sponsor link, referral pool |
| user-service | 8202 | `users` | profiles, follows, Circles, preferences, blocks |
| social-service | 8203 | `social` | posts, feed modes, algorithm marketplace, reactions |
| community-service | 8204 | `community` | communities, forums, forum-to-knowledge |
| family-service | 8205 | `family` | the genealogical graph, verification, heritage |
| memorial-service | 8206 | `memorial` | Digital Graveyard, tributes, QR codes |
| messaging-service | 8207 | `messaging` | E2E messenger, WebSocket delivery, notifications |
| creator-service | 8208 | `creator` | creator studio, publishing engine, subscriptions |
| commerce-service | 8209 | `commerce` | marketplace with escrow, ad platform |
| ledger-service | 8210 | `ledger` | immutable ledger, wallets, commissions, escrow, Kinjy Leaders |
| payment-service | 8211 | `payment` | NowPayments/Mangopay rails, KYC, payout batches |
| ai-service | 8212 | `ai` | AI gateway, translation, the Kaluta Assistant |
| media-service | 8213 | `media` | uploads, provenance labels |

All services share one Postgres instance but each owns a private schema, so no
service can reach another's tables through the ORM.

## Working on it

Source is bind-mounted and uvicorn runs with `--reload`, so editing a file on
the host reloads that container. Only dependency changes need a rebuild:

```bash
docker compose build auth-service && docker compose up -d auth-service
```

Useful commands:

```bash
docker compose logs -f ledger-service
```

```bash
docker compose exec postgres psql -U kaluta -d kaluta -c "\dn"
```

## Running the tests

One command, and it runs everything:

```bash
python backend/tests/run_all.py
```

It discovers every suite in `backend/tests/` rather than working from a list,
because a list maintained by whoever is running the tests is how
`e2e_messaging_age` sat red in the tree for three days: the change that broke
its setup was followed by a run of four suites chosen by hand, and that was not
one of them.

It also refuses to treat a silent success as a pass. The suite that was missed
exited **0** on the run that missed it, because it died in an assertion during
setup before printing anything, and a grep for `ALL CHECKS PASSED` found
nothing and said nothing. A suite that exits 0 without printing its verdict is
reported as `CRASH`.

Before running anything it checks that every service is up *and answering as
itself* - a port that answers as the wrong service makes every "this is
refused" assertion meaningless, which is the oldest trap in this repository.

Other things worth knowing:

- `--list` shows what would run; `-k <text>` narrows it.
- Suites that exit **2** are skipped on purpose - `e2e_moderation_admin.py`
  promotes throwaway accounts to admin, so it refuses to run against anything
  but a local stack. Skips are listed separately and never counted as passes.
- Set `KINJY_API` to test a deployed stack. Suites with a port written into
  them are skipped rather than run, since they would quietly test localhost and
  report a pass for an environment they never touched.

## Try the economy without writing anything

The blueprint's split formulas are implemented in `backend/common/economy.py`
and exposed as a pure simulation:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8200/api/ledger/simulate -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"kind":"ad_purchase","amount":"1000"}'
```

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8200/api/ledger/rules
```

## What is real and what is not

Deliberately explicit, because a half-wired money path is worse than an obvious gap:

- **Real:** account lifecycle, JWT + sessions, the direct sponsor lookup, all
  split maths with exact-sum guarantees, double-entry posting with idempotency
  and reversals, the family graph and its derived relationships, feed ranking
  and the honest "why am I seeing this", escrowed orders, ad floor enforcement.
- **Mocked, clearly labelled:** payment rails run in mock mode until
  `NOWPAYMENTS_API_KEY` / Mangopay credentials are set; the AI gateway routes
  and meters for real but every provider currently returns mock output.
- **Not started:** WebAuthn registration/assertion ceremonies (the tables and
  endpoints exist, the ceremony does not), C2PA signing, Mangopay live calls,
  live-streaming, the developer app marketplace.

## Frontend ↔ backend

The frontend talks only to the gateway. `app/src/lib/api.ts` holds the client
(token storage, transparent refresh on 401, uniform error messages) and
`app/src/hooks/useApi.ts` the fetch-on-mount hook.

Wired to live data today:

| Surface | Endpoint | What it replaces |
|---|---|---|
| Home · economy section | `/api/ledger/rules` | hard-coded 40/5/9/46, 20%, 10% |
| Feeds · Algorithm Marketplace | `/api/algorithms` | a static list of 21 fictional entries |

Both keep their published copy as a fallback and say so on screen, so a service
being down degrades the page instead of blanking it.

Publishing an algorithm through the API makes it appear in the marketplace,
attributed to its developer:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8200/api/algorithms -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"id":"kigoma_farmers","name":"Kigoma Farmers","description":"Regional market prices first.","weight_locality":1.4}'
```

### Authentication

`/join` is the public entry point (`?mode=signin|signup`, `?ref=CODE` carries the
inviter). `AuthProvider` in `app/src/lib/auth.tsx` holds the session; read it
with `useAuth()`. Access tokens live in localStorage and refresh transparently on
a 401 — a failure that is *not* a 401 never signs the member out, so a service
blip doesn't cost them their session.

`/dashboard` is route-guarded and covers the blueprint's member surface:

| Tab | Backs onto | Blueprint |
|---|---|---|
| Earnings | `/wallet`, `/commissions`, `/payments/eligibility`, `/payments/destinations` | §10 §11 + the $1 payout gate |
| Verification | `/kyc/status`, `/kyc/start` | §20 — fee and identity check kept separate |
| Security | `/auth/sessions`, `/auth/passkeys` | §5 — device manager, no central biometric store |
| Account | `/auth/account/delete` | §4 — deactivate or delete, no justification asked |

Try it:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8200/api/auth/register -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"email":"you@example.com","password":"KalutaDemo123!","display_name":"Your Name","handle":"your.handle"}'
```

### Social Hub — the real feed

`/hub` is the member's feed (`/feeds` remains the public marketing page). It
implements the blueprint's first two mandatory refinements against live services:

- **Explicit feed modes.** All ten come from `/api/feed/modes`. `Following` is
  strictly reverse-chronological and the UI says so — a ranked feed labelled
  chronological would be the exact conflict the blueprint set out to resolve.
- **"Why am I seeing this?"** sits at the **top** of each card as a `?` — the
  reader wonders why a post is there *before* reading it, not after the
  reactions. It gives two answers, kept apart:
  - **Selection** — which rule put the post in this feed ("It is one of the most
    recent posts", "Tagged #technology", "You follow the author", "The author
    made it public").
  - **Ordering** — the algorithm, its score and each component, **only when the
    mode actually ranks**. On a chronological feed it says so instead.

  That split was a correctness fix, not a cosmetic one: the panel used to report
  `Ranked by chronological · score 0.464` on the unranked `new` feed, describing
  a ranking that never ran. An unknown algorithm now degrades to the selection
  reasons rather than blanking the answer.
- **"Show less like this"** posts a signal to `/api/feed/signals` and the next
  ranking honours it visibly: the same post drops to `score 0.191` with a named
  `You asked for less like this −0.50` factor.
- **Provenance is declared, not guessed.** The composer asks the author
  (Original / AI assisted / AI generated) because the platform cannot detect
  assistance reliably, and the label travels with the post.

### Circles — private audiences

`/circles` (user-service) is the blueprint's module D: Family, Close friends,
Business, Customers, Custom and **Smart** circles. A circle is a private list —
only its owner sees who is in it, and nobody is told they were added. What it
controls is reach: **a post shared to a circle is read by its members and its
author, and by nobody else.**

- **One audience rule, every door.** `social-service` asks
  `/internal/viewer-audience/{id}` (who you follow, which circles reach you) on
  every read, and applies the same rule to the feed, the shorts reel, an
  author's page, a direct link, media, "Why am I seeing this?", reactions,
  comments, views and notifications. Only public posts can be reshared — a
  repost carries the original inside it. The realtime hub grants a `post:<id>`
  topic only to someone who may read the post, so a removed member cannot keep
  listening to who comments.
- **Checked at read time, never copied.** Removing someone, a block, or an
  unfollow closes the door on the very next request.
- **Smart circles hold no list.** A rule — connections, followers, people you
  follow or mutual follows, optionally narrowed to a country and/or city from
  the member's own profile — is evaluated at every read.
- **The messaging rule applies.** An adult cannot add an unconnected minor (one
  generic refusal, naming no age), and a block or a disconnection stops an
  existing circle reaching them; the owner sees them flagged "Not reached".
- **Bounded.** Up to 100 circles per member and 5,000 people per circle, since
  every read recomputes the audience.

```bash
python backend/tests/e2e_circles.py   # 80 checks, live API
```

### Digital Graveyard — memorials

`/graveyard` (memorial-service) is the blueprint's §8. The code engraved on a
resting place opens **`/memorial/:code`**, which works **without an account**:
whoever scans a headstone reads the life story and timeline, sees the resting
place, lights a candle, leaves a flower or signs the guest book.

- **Public or private.** A private memorial is a 404 to everyone but its
  administrators — by id, by QR code and in search.
- **The family approves the words.** Candles and flowers go up at once;
  messages and photos wait for an administrator, who is notified — with the
  text of the message, except to an administrator who is a minor, who is only
  told something is waiting. An administrator's own words go up at once. A
  memorial can open its guest book to members, but a visitor without an account
  always waits — and signs as "A visitor" unless they leave words. The guest
  book lists words and photos, a page at a time; candles and flowers are
  counted, and an administrator can take any tribute down from **Manage**.
- **Files are the family's own.** A portrait, cover or voice recording must be
  the uploader's file, and is served through short-lived signed links.
- **A gallery of photos and videos** (up to 60, 500 MB in all). Photos are JPEG,
  PNG or WebP up to 25 MB; videos MP4 or WebM up to 50 MB. media-service checks
  the first bytes against the declared type, so a picture cannot pass as a video.
  Each item has a caption, an origin label (original, edited, AI assisted, AI
  generated, verified source), and a "sensitive" mark that blurs it until the
  visitor chooses to look. Visitors open it in a viewer (arrow keys, Escape, a
  video player that seeks); the family orders it, and can promote an approved
  visitor photo into it. Removing an item deletes the family's own file.
- **Up to three administrators**, in succession order. Naming one is contact,
  so it follows the messaging rules: the member must accept it from you (by
  default, be connected first), blocks apply, and an adult cannot name an
  unconnected minor. The order is a ranking — you can step down, or remove
  those after you, never one ahead of you; the last cannot leave, and only the
  first can delete.
- **A resting place is "captured at the grave"** only if the device reported a
  position within 50 m. A desktop browser's network guess, or a claim with no
  accuracy at all, is saved but shown as not yet confirmed.
- **Anniversary reminders are sent** 10 days, 3 days and 6 hours before, by a
  sweep safe to run on several workers, and roll over to the next year.
- **Death verification**: any member can report with evidence (once each, while
  theirs is open); Kinjy staff take it under review and verify or refuse it from
  `/graveyard`.
- **Links are renewed.** Pictures, voice and documents are fetched with
  five-minute tickets; a page left open re-reads itself every four minutes, and
  the voice recording picks up where it was.

```bash
python backend/tests/e2e_graveyard.py   # 88 checks, live API (needs .env for the staff token)
```

### Universal Navigation — the signed-in app

Signing in swaps the marketing nav for the blueprint's Universal Navigation: a
desktop rail and the five-entry mobile bottom bar (`AppShell`). Every entry
opens its own page against a live service.

| Nav entry | Route | Service |
|---|---|---|
| Home / Following / For You / Public | `/hub?mode=…` | social |
| Forums | `/forums` | community |
| Circles | `/circles` | user |
| Communities | `/communities` | community |
| Messages | `/messages` | messaging |
| Live | `/live` | — nothing built; the page says so |
| Family Tree | `/tree` | family |
| Digital Graveyard | `/graveyard` | memorial |
| Explore | `/explore` | community + commerce + family |
| Marketplace | `/market` | commerce |
| Earnings | `/dashboard` | ledger + payment + auth |

**Family tree.** `/tree` shows the family around one person (a drawing on a wide
screen, a list by generation on a phone) and lets a member add, link, edit and
remove people and confirm what they know. The rules live in family-service, not
the screen: you read a tree you belong to (or one its owner opened, through
`who_can_see_family`), you write only where you belong, and a member's node needs
that member's `who_can_add_family`. The server refuses relations that contradict
each other and tells the screen what each person may do. `FEATURES.familyTreeApp`
opens the app side; the public `/family` page stays behind `FEATURES.familyTree`.
What is not built is listed in `NOT-DONE.md` ("Family tree").

Live is the one entry with no backend. Rather than a convincing mock, its page
states plainly that nothing runs behind it — a screen that looks finished is how
a gap survives until someone demos it.

### The Kaluta Assistant

A floating orb on every page (`components/assistant/LiveAssistant.tsx`) talking
to `ai-service`. It **repositions per module** — beside the composer on the feed,
top-right on the family tree, bottom-left on the dashboard — and every answer is
grounded in the knowledge base, role-scoped, and cited.

The knowledge base holds **245 rows: 49 topics × 5 languages**, seeded from
`src/components/assistant/knowledgeBase.ts` — content already written for this
purpose, moved server-side rather than restated more thinly:

```bash
docker compose exec web node seed-kb.cjs <admin-email> <password> http://gateway:8000/api
```

Check what it knows: `curl localhost:8200/api/assistant/kb/stats`

Behaviours worth knowing:

- **It replies in the language of the question**, not the interface. Arabic and
  Chinese are settled by script; French, Swahili and English by a function-word
  vote, because guessing from the Latin alphabet answered French questions in
  English.
- **Accent-insensitive**: "cimetiere" matches "cimetière".
- **Role-scoped**: earnings answers are `member,admin`, so a visitor asking
  about payouts is told nothing — that is the gate working, not a miss.
- **It refuses to invent.** With no grounded match it says so. Two response
  formats are offered on every grounded answer: written (illustration + numbered
  steps) and a scripted walkthrough clip.
- Voice input uses the Web Speech API where the browser has it.

### Signed-in layout

The signed-in app wears the product design from the `/app` demo, not a generic
dashboard layout. On the app routes (listed in `Layout.tsx`) the marketing navbar
and footer are **suppressed** — `AppShell` is the chrome there, and rendering both
gave two stacked headers. The logo in the top bar is the way back to the public
site. `AppShell` composes:

- **`AppTopBar`** — logo, search (→ `/explore`), language, the
  **Cloud / Light / Dark / System** switcher, notifications, avatar.
- **`AppChipBar`** — **destinations only**, and only the ones you pinned; the rest
  sit under "All modules", where the pin control lives. Fifteen chips at once read
  as a wall, so pinning decides what is on the bar rather than merely reordering
  an exhaustive list. Following / For You / Public are deliberately **not** here:
  they are modes of the feed, not places, and they live in the feed's own mode
  selector (`navigation.ts` — `NAV_DESTINATIONS`).
- **Three columns** — profile mini-card rail, working column, optional
  `RailCard` context rail. Below `lg` the rails collapse to the mobile bottom bar.

Everything paints through the theme tokens from `appdemo/theme`, so switching
display mode restyles the whole app rather than one framed demo. `AppThemeProvider`
sits in `main.tsx` with `persist`, keeping the choice across reloads and syncing
`display_mode` to `/preferences`; the demo at `/app` nests its own throwaway
provider so it cannot overwrite the member's setting.

Labels and icons come from `CHROME_STRINGS` / `MODULE_ICONS`, already translated
into the five languages — `components/app/navigation.ts` only maps each
`ChromeKey` to a route.

### Posting

The composer is collapsed in the feed — avatar, a one-line prompt, and
Photo / Video / Article shortcuts — and the full form opens in a **dialog**. Past
220px of scroll the card steps aside and a floating button takes over, so the
feed keeps the width. Visibility and provenance sit in the dialog where they are
legible; topics, city and language hide behind the tag button until wanted.

Articles get a **WYSIWYG** (`RichTextEditor`): bold, italic, strike, headings,
quote, code, lists, links. The headline becomes the document's first `<h2>`, so a
stored article is one self-contained HTML document.

**That markup is an XSS boundary.** `lib/richtext.ts` rebuilds it against a tag
and attribute whitelist — parse, walk, keep only what is named, drop the rest —
so an unknown tag is safe by default rather than dangerous by default. Links are
limited to http/https/mailto. Sanitising runs on save *and* on render, because
the database can hold rows this code never wrote. Paste is forced to plain text.
Verified: `<script>`, `<img onerror>` and `javascript:` hrefs are stripped while
headings, lists and bold survive.

### Reactions, hashtags, media preview

**Reactions** — like, celebrate, support, insightful, love. One per member per
post: picking a second replaces the first, tapping the current one clears it.
Counts ship inline with each post so a feed of 20 does not fire 20 extra
requests. `likes_count` stays the total across all kinds, so existing ranking
signals keep working without a migration.

**Hashtags** are extracted from the body server-side and merged into the post's
topics — a member who writes `#agriculture` gets the same reach as one who filled
the topics box. The pattern accepts accented, Arabic and CJK characters; an
English-only `\w` would silently drop a Swahili or Arabic tag.

The composer shows detected tags as chips **while you type**, using the same
pattern as the server — a tag shown as recognised in the UI but dropped on save
would be worse than no feedback at all.

In the feed a tag links to `?mode=topics&topic=…`, and the feed's topic, city and
country filters are **read from the URL**. They used to be local state, so a
hashtag link switched the mode and then ignored the topic: the feed came back
unfiltered and clicking a tag looked like it did nothing.

**Media preview** — click an image for a full-screen viewer with keyboard paging.
It is portalled to `<body>`: every `.cloud-card` has a `backdrop-filter`, which
establishes a containing block, so `position: fixed` inside a card resolves
against the card rather than the viewport.

### Threaded comments

Two visual levels — a comment and a reply. Anything deeper **flattens**: the
server re-attaches it to the branch root and records `reply_to`, and the client
prefills an `@handle` mention. Indentation stops being able to show who answered
whom once a thread runs out of horizontal room, so the mention carries it
instead (`MAX_COMMENT_DEPTH` in social-service).

Author handles are resolved in one batch via `POST /internal/profiles` rather
than a request per row; if user-service is unreachable the thread still renders
with ids. Mentions are highlighted by splitting text nodes — never by injecting
markup.

### Profiles

Every avatar in the app is the same component (`MemberAvatar`) and every one of
them links to `/u/{handle}`. Before, each surface drew its own initials block, so
an avatar was clickable in some places and inert in others, and the same person's
colour differed between the feed and the rail. The fallback colour is now derived
from the handle, so one member keeps one colour everywhere — which makes a
comment thread scannable without reading a name.

The profile page carries the cover, identity, follower counts, the relationship
actions (Follow / Connect / Message, each reflecting what the permission check
allows) and the member's posts. Post authors are resolved **in one batch per
page**, not one request per card.

`GET /posts/by/{author_id}` applies visibility server-side: a visitor gets public
posts only, and follower-only posts never enter the payload. Verified — the owner
sees 8 posts (`followers`, `public`), a visitor sees 7 (`public`).

### Follow vs connect, and privacy

Two different relationships, deliberately:

- **Follow** is one-way and needs nobody's permission.
- **Connect** is an invitation the other person accepts, and **that acceptance is
  what unlocks messaging, family links and community invites.**

Each member sets the rules in Dashboard → Privacy (`who_can_invite`,
`who_can_message`, `who_can_add_family`, `who_can_add_community`,
`discoverable`), each `everyone | connections | nobody`. Defaults are the
cautious reading: anyone may *ask* to connect; only an accepted connection may
message you.

**The rules are enforced server-side.** messaging-service asks
`/internal/permissions/{actor}/{target}` before creating a conversation and
**fails closed** — if user-service is unreachable it refuses rather than assumes
yes, so an outage cannot become a way around someone's setting. Verified end to
end: chat refused before connecting, refused while pending, allowed after
acceptance, and refused again once the target sets `who_can_message=nobody`.

That permission logic lives in one place. Three services re-deriving "are they
connected?" would drift, and the copy that drifts is the one that leaks.

### Suggestions

The feed rail suggests **people, communities and forums** (`/users/suggestions`,
`/discover`). Each list states the ranking it actually used — "Most followed on
Kaluta", "Most active right now" — rather than implying a personalisation that
does not exist yet. Already-followed, blocked and blocking accounts are excluded;
**secret communities never appear**, since a suggestion list is exactly the leak
that would undo them.

The feed header is one menu rather than ten chips — the modes carry their
descriptions inside it, which the chip row never had room for.

Lenis smooth scroll is **off** on app routes: eased scrolling is a brochure
flourish that costs latency through a feed and takes over `window.scrollTo`. Attached media renders in the card: one image
full-width, several in a grid, videos with controls. `/shorts` is the vertical
reel — a short is simply a post whose format is video, and an IntersectionObserver
plays only the clip on screen.

### Real-time

The gateway relays WebSockets (`/api/ws` → messaging-service), so the browser
still talks to one origin. `useRealtime` reconnects with backoff and the UI shows
Live / Reconnecting rather than silently going stale. Direct messages and Live
room chat share the same socket.

The access token is the socket's **first frame** (`{"action":"auth","token":…}`),
never the URL, so no proxy log holds it. The server closes the socket with
**4401** when that token expires; the client refreshes and reconnects, and the
messages page then fetches `?after=<last id>` so nothing sent during the gap is
lost. `messaging-test.py` checks all of it with two fresh members.

On top of that socket, `/messages` has:

- **Friends** — every accepted connection in a strip above the conversations,
  online first; one tap opens (or reuses) the thread. Pending invitations are
  answered there too. **See all** opens the full list with a search (name or
  @handle, case- and accent-insensitive: "helene" finds Hélène) and an
  Online-only filter; it filters the already-loaded list locally.
- **Optimistic send** — the bubble shows at once; the request carries a
  `client_id`, so a retry after a lost response never stores the message twice.
- **Read receipts** — `POST /conversations/{id}/read`, sent only while the thread
  is on screen. Fetching a thread no longer marks it read.
- **Typing** — a `typing` frame, relayed only to members of that thread.
- **Presence** — online / last seen, visible to connections and conversation
  partners only (`GET /presence`). Held in memory: `last_seen` is unknown after a
  restart, and a 5 s grace keeps reconnects from flickering.
- **Offline notification** — one per thread while unread, never the text of an
  encrypted message.
- **Attachments of any type** — photos, video, audio and PDFs play inline; any
  other file is a download card. Drag and drop, paste a screenshot, or record a
  voice message. Upload with `purpose=chat`; posts still accept only formats a
  browser renders. messaging-service takes a `media_id` and asks media-service
  what it is and who owns it — no client-supplied URL, type or size is stored.
- **Serving is the XSS boundary.** Media is served from the app's own origin, so
  only image/video/audio/PDF go out inline; everything else (HTML, SVG, scripts,
  unknown bytes) is `application/octet-stream` + `attachment`, and every
  response carries `nosniff` and a `sandbox` CSP (PDF excepted — Chrome will not
  open a sandboxed PDF).
- **Privacy holds on every message**, not only when a thread is created: a
  block or `who_can_message=nobody` ends an existing direct conversation, and a
  blocked member no longer sees the other's presence or typing.
- **Phones** — list and thread are two screens, driven by `?c=`; the back button
  and the back gesture both return to the list. Nothing is opened, or marked
  read, while it is not on screen.
- **Encryption at rest** — with `MESSAGES_ENCRYPTION_KEY` set, message text,
  attachment names and the attachment files themselves are sealed with
  AES-256-GCM (`backend/common/crypto.py`); message notifications carry no
  text. A copy of the database, a backup or the media volume reads as noise.
  It is **not** end-to-end: the running server holds the key. Required in
  production — messaging-service and media-service refuse to start without it,
  `bootstrap.sh` generates it, `deploy.sh` checks it. Messages written before the
  key existed are sealed in the background at startup, attachment files too;
  listing a second key (`k2:…,k1:…`) rotates, and both services re-seal what
  the old key sealed — remove it only once both logs say so (see
  `.env.production.example`). **Losing the key loses the messages** — keep a
  copy offline, never beside the backups.
- **Private attachments** — a chat file is served only on a link messaging-service
  signs for someone in the conversation (12 h, HMAC), never on its bare URL;
  Range requests work on sealed files, so video seeks. Post media keeps its own
  short-lived, age-checked tickets (`backend/common/mediasign.py`).
- **Dates** — day separators (Today / Yesterday / weekday / date), time only on
  bubbles, the full moment on hover, all in the app's chosen language.

### Passkeys

The WebAuthn ceremony is wired end to end: `/auth/passkeys/register/options` →
`navigator.credentials.create()` → `/register/verify`, and the same shape for
sign-in. Challenges are single-use, stored in Redis when reachable. Kaluta keeps
a public key and a signature counter — never a biometric.

### Live — what is real and what is not

`/live` gives **real-time chat** (a live room is a group conversation) and a
**local camera preview**. Video is *not* broadcast: there is no ingest server,
no transcoder and no CDN, so nobody else receives the stream. The page says so
on screen rather than showing a convincing player.

The marketing pages under `/platform`, `/feeds`, `/family` etc. remain the public
showcase and keep their designed content.

### GSAP inside React

Use `useGSAP` from `@gsap/react`, never `useEffect`. `ScrollTrigger`'s `pin`
re-parents the pinned node into a `.pin-spacer`; a `useEffect` cleanup runs after
React has already detached the node, so the revert lands too late and React's own
`removeChild` throws, killing every navigation.

## Database migrations

Tables are created on startup with `create_all`, which only creates *missing
tables* — it never adds a column to an existing one. Once the schema is in use,
a column change needs a real migration; add Alembic before that point.
